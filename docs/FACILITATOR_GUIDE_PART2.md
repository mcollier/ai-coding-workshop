---

## Module 1: Copilot Interaction Models (0:10 – 0:35, 25 min)

### Section Breakdown

- **0:10-0:15** - Presentation: Ask/Edit/Agent overview (slides 6-10)
- **0:15-0:25** - Live Demo: Same task, three ways
- **0:25-0:30** - Guided Exercise: Participants try each mode
- **0:30-0:35** - Discussion and Q&A

### Facilitator Actions

**Presentation (5 min)**
- Use slides 6-10 to explain the three modes
- Key point: **Agent Mode is not "better chat"** – it's a different execution model
- Show the decision tree diagram ([copilot-interaction-models.md](design/diagrams/copilot-interaction-models.md))

**Live Demo: Same Task, Three Ways (10 min)**

**Task:** Add a `Priority` property to the Task entity

1. **Ask Mode Demo:**
   - Open Copilot Chat
   - Prompt: "How should I add a Priority property to the Task entity?"
   - Show: You get guidance, but no changes

2. **Edit Mode Demo:**
   - Open `src/TaskManager.Domain/Tasks/Task.cs`
   - Use inline chat (`Ctrl+I`): "Add a Priority property of type TaskPriority enum"
   - Show: Direct file modification

3. **Agent Mode Demo:**
   - Open Copilot Chat in Agent Mode
   - Prompt: "Add a Priority property to Task entity across all layers"
   - Show: Multi-step plan with checkpoints

**Key Observation Points:**
- Scope: Ask (informational), Edit (file-level), Agent (repository-level)
- Control: Ask (total), Edit (review diff), Agent (approve steps)
- Speed: Ask (instant), Edit (fast), Agent (deliberate)

**Guided Exercise (5 min)**
- Participants try all three modes with a simple task
- Circulate to help with agent mode activation
- Troubleshoot: If agents don't appear, check `.agent.md` files exist

**Discussion Questions (5 min)**
- When would you use Ask vs Edit?
- What scenarios require Agent mode?
- What are the risks of Agent mode?

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Agent mode doesn't appear  
**Fix:** Ensure Copilot extension is updated, restart VS Code, verify `.agent.md` files

**Issue:** Agent mode produces unexpected results  
**Fix:** Agents are non-deterministic; emphasize human review of plans

## Module 1.5: Skills & Customization Hierarchy (0:35 – 1:05, 30 min)

### Overview

This NEW module introduces the complete Copilot customization landscape. Participants learn about **four customization types** and understand when to use each. Focus is on **Agent Skills**, the newest addition to Copilot's toolkit.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the four customization types (Skills, Agents, Instructions, Prompt Files)
- Differentiate between Skills and Agents (most common confusion)
- Know when to use each customization approach
- Explore a skill's structure and invocation methods

### Section Breakdown

- **0:35-0:40** - Presentation: Customization landscape overview (5 min)
- **0:40-0:45** - Discussion: Skills vs Agents (5 min)
- **0:45-1:00** - Guided Exercise: Lab 06 Parts 1-2 (15 min)
- **1:00-1:05** - Exercise: Lab 06 Part 3 decision scenarios (5 min)

### Facilitator Actions

**Intro (5 min) - Present the Four Types**

Show the customization hierarchy:

```
1. Custom Instructions - Always-on standards
2. Agent Skills - Portable capabilities
3. Custom Agents - Role-based personas  
4. Prompt Files - Quick one-off tasks
```

**Key Message:** "Different tools for different jobs. No single customization type fits all scenarios."

**Quick Poll:** Ask: "Before today, who has used custom instructions? Agents? Skills?"
- Most will have used instructions, some agents, few skills
- This sets context for why Skills are exciting/new

**Skills Introduction (3 min)**

Emphasize what makes Skills unique:
- **Portable**: Works in VS Code, CLI, cloud agents
- **Includes resources**: Not just instructions, but scripts and templates
- **Task-specific**: Focused capabilities, not persistent personas
- **Open standard**: agentskills.io specification

**Demo concept:** "Think of Skills as a specialized toolkit you hand to any agent. Agents are specialists you hire for specific roles."

**Discussion: Skills vs Agents (5 min)**

This is the critical differentiation. Use concrete examples:

| Scenario | Use... | Why? |
|----------|--------|------|
| Database migration checklist | **Skill** | Portable capability with scripts |
| Architecture review workflow | **Agent** | Role-based, needs tool restrictions |
| "Always use sealed classes" | **Instructions** | Coding standard, always applied |
| Generate PR description once | **Prompt File** | One-off task |

**Ask participants:** "If you need to review code for security issues, what would you use?"
- Answer: **Agent** (role-based, needs read-only tools)
- Not a Skill (Skills don't restrict tools)

**Lab 06 - Guided Walkthrough**

**Part 1 (5 min)**: Walk through the decision framework together
- Show the decision tree
- Point out the comparison table
- Have participants bookmark this page for reference

**Part 2 (10 min)**: Explore skills hands-on
- If your repo has skills, demonstrate one
- If not, use `/create-skill` to generate an example
- Show both slash command invocation and automatic loading
- **Key point:** Skills only load when relevant (efficient context)

**Part 3 (5 min)**: Decision scenarios
- Have participants work through scenarios individually
- Quick share-out: "What did you choose for Scenario 1?"
- Emphasize: There can be multiple valid answers depending on context

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use Skills and Agents together?**  
A: Yes! Skills provide capabilities, agents use those capabilities. They complement each other.

**Q: Should I convert my agents to skills?**  
A: No. If your agent needs tool restrictions or role-based behavior, keep it as an agent. Skills are for portable capabilities without tool restrictions.

**Q: Where do Skills live?**  
A: Project: `.github/skills/`, User: `~/.copilot/skills/`. Plus alternate locations like `.claude/skills/`.

**Q: Are Skills available in all Copilot environments?**  
A: Yes - VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and GitHub Copilot coding agent (cloud). That's what makes them portable.

### Transition to Module 2

"Now that we understand the full customization landscape and where Skills fit, let's dive deeper into **Custom Agents** - the workflow orchestration specialists. Skills give agents capabilities; agents coordinate workflows."

---

## Module 2: Custom Agents Intro (1:05 – 1:30, 25 min)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Custom Agents Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** Agents don't show in Copilot Chat dropdown

**Fixes:**
1. Verify `.agent.md` files exist in `.github/agents/`
2. Check YAML front-matter syntax (name, description, tools, model)
3. Restart VS Code
4. Update GitHub Copilot extension to latest version
5. Verify workspace is a git repository

### Agent Behavior Inconsistent

**Symptoms:** Same prompt yields different results

**Explanation:** This is expected! LLMs are non-deterministic.

**Guidance:**
- Emphasize structured outputs reduce variance
- Teach participants to refine prompts iteratively
- Normalize re-running agents for better results

### Agent Goes Off-Track

**Symptoms:** Agent produces output outside its scope

**Fixes:**
- Add stronger constraints (NEVER clauses)
- Narrow the role definition
- Add examples of out-of-scope scenarios
- Refine output format to be more prescriptive

### Participants Struggle with Agent Design

**Symptoms:** Blank stares during capstone lab

**Facilitator Actions:**
- Pair participants for collaborative design
- Provide scaffolded templates with partial completion
- Walk through one example agent design as a group
- Simplify: Start with Code Reviewer agent (most familiar)

### Time Management Issues

**If running behind:**
- Skip Exercise 2 in Lab 08 (iteration exercise)
- Reduce capstone to Steps 1-3 only (no testing)
- Skip group share in Module 5

**If running ahead:**
- Add Bonus Challenge in Lab 09
- Facilitate deeper governance discussion
- Do live agent design as a group exercise

## Appendix C: Frequently Asked Questions

### Before the Workshop

**Q: Do participants need to complete Part 1 first?**  
A: No, but they should be comfortable with GitHub Copilot for code generation and chat.

**Q: What if participants don't have Copilot access?**  
A: They can't fully participate. Ensure Copilot licenses are provisioned in advance.

**Q: How technical is Part 2 compared to Part 1?**  
A: Less coding, more conceptual. Focus is on design, workflows, and governance.

### During the Workshop

**Q: Why use custom agents instead of just better prompts?**  
A: Agents provide consistency, encode team knowledge, and are reusable across the team.

**Q: Can agents execute code changes automatically?**  
A: Agent mode requires human approval at checkpoints. Never blindly trust agent output.

**Q: How do we prevent "prompt sprawl" with many agents?**  
A: Maintain a catalog, enforce review process, deprecate unused agents.

**Q: Should agents be org-wide or team-specific?**  
A: Both. Architecture/Security agents → org-wide. Workflow agents → team-specific.

### After the Workshop

**Q: How do I measure agent adoption success?**  
A: Track: agent usage frequency, time saved, consistency improvements, team feedback.

**Q: What if my custom agent doesn't work well?**  
A: Normal! Iterate on instructions, test with more scenarios, gather team feedback.

**Q: Can I share my custom agents publicly?**  
A: Yes, but ensure they don't contain proprietary knowledge or security-sensitive rules.
