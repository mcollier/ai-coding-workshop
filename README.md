# Workshop: Using AI for Application Development with GitHub Copilot (.NET Edition)

## Overview

Transform the way you build software with AI-powered development! This comprehensive workshop teaches developers how to leverage **GitHub Copilot** and modern AI coding assistants to accelerate application development while maintaining high code quality standards.

**This workshop is split into two parts:**

### Part 1: Fundamentals (3 hours)
Learn AI assistance across the entire development lifecycle—from requirements gathering to code generation, testing, and documentation. Using **.NET 9**, **Visual Studio Code**, and **GitHub Copilot**, you'll experience firsthand how AI can amplify developer productivity while following industry best practices like **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design**, and **Test-Driven Development**.

### Part 2: Advanced GitHub Copilot (3 hours)
Master advanced Copilot features including **interaction models** (Ask/Edit/Agent), **the Skills system**, **custom agents**, and **workflow automation**. Learn the complete customization hierarchy (Prompts → Instructions → Skills → Agents), discover capabilities with slash commands, and design production-ready agents that encode team knowledge and standardize AI-assisted development workflows.

**Full workshop duration:** 6 hours (can be delivered as separate sessions or combined)

**What makes this workshop unique:**
- **Practical, hands-on labs** with real-world scenarios, not just demos
- **Complete customization hierarchy**: Instructions, Skills, and Agents working together
- **Enterprise-grade patterns** including Clean Architecture and DDD
- **TDD-first approach** with AI generating tests before implementation  
- **Pre-configured dev environment** via VS Code Dev Containers—no setup hassles
- **Repository-level Copilot instructions** demonstrating team-wide AI consistency
- **Skills exploration** with working examples (test-data-generator) showcasing domain knowledge without tool access
- **Production-ready agent design** including handoffs, invocation control, and governance patterns
- **Modern .NET 9** with Minimal APIs and OpenTelemetry observability

Whether you're new to AI-assisted development or looking to level up your Copilot skills, this workshop provides the practical experience and best practices you need to integrate AI into your daily workflow effectively.

This repository contains all workshop materials including lab guides, starter code, reference implementations, and facilitator resources.



## VS Code & Devcontainer Setup

For the best experience, use the provided **Devcontainer** and recommended VS Code settings:

- **Devcontainer**: Ensures a consistent .NET 9, Node, and extension environment for all participants. No local setup required—just open in VS Code and "Reopen in Container" when prompted.
- **Copilot Custom Instructions**: This repo auto-applies Copilot instructions for Clean Architecture, DDD, and .NET 9. For best results, review or copy the full instructions from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` into your Copilot Chat settings.


---
## Prerequisites

## Using the Dev Container (Recommended)

For a fully pre-configured .NET 9 development environment, you can use the included **Dev Container**. This is the fastest way to get started and ensures all required tools and extensions are installed.

**How to use:**
1. Open this repository in VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. Select: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
4. VS Code will build and open the project in a container with .NET 9, GitHub CLI, Copilot, C# Dev Kit, and all required extensions.

_This is optional but highly recommended, especially if you want to avoid manual environment setup or ensure consistency across all participants._

Before attending this workshop, participants should have:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Active subscription and extension installed in VS Code
- **.NET 9 SDK**: Installed and verified with `dotnet --version`
- **Visual Studio Code**: Latest version with C# Dev Kit extension
- **Git**: Basic familiarity with git commands
- **C# Experience**: Comfortable with basic C# syntax and concepts
- **GitHub Account**: For cloning repositories and accessing Copilot

### Environment Check

Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash
dotnet --version          # Should show 9.x.x
git --version            # Any recent version
code --version           # VS Code version
```

### Pre-Workshop Preparation

**Participants**: Please complete the [Pre-Workshop Environment Checklist](docs/PRE_WORKSHOP_CHECKLIST.md) **before** attending the workshop to ensure your environment is fully configured. This will allow us to maximize hands-on learning time.

## Best Practices for Using Copilot, Skills & Agents

To get the most out of Copilot, Skills, and AI agents in this workshop:

- **Discover capabilities first**: Use `/help`, `/agents`, and `/skills` slash commands to explore what's available
- **Always ask for a plan first**: Use Copilot or Agent Mode to propose a step-by-step plan before making large or multi-file changes
- **Use Skills for knowledge**: Invoke skills like `#test-data-generator` for domain expertise and templates without needing file access
- **Use Agents for workflows**: Select custom agents like `@plan`, `@architect`, or `@architecture-reviewer` for multi-step tasks requiring tool access
- **Use the Check agent for code review**: Select the **Check** Copilot agent from the agents dropdown in Copilot Chat to get improvement suggestions before submitting a PR
- **Leverage chat participants**: Use `@workspace` for codebase questions, `@terminal` for CLI help, and `@vscode` for editor tips
- **Be explicit in prompts**: Reference files, selections, or context variables (e.g., `#file`, `#selection`) for targeted results
- **Review and iterate**: Treat Copilot suggestions as a starting point—review, refactor, and test as you would with any code

See the [Facilitator Guide](docs/FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md), [Customization Decision Guide](docs/guides/customization-decision-guide.md), and `.github/agents/Check.agent.md` for more workflow tips.
