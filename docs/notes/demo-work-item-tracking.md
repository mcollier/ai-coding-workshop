# Demo Work Item Tracking - demo/coi Branch

**Date Created:** November 18, 2025  
**Demo Branch:** `demo/coi`  
**GitHub Issue:** [#12 - Upgrade Task Repository from In-Memory to Azure Cosmos DB](https://github.com/centricconsulting/ai-coding-workshop/issues/12)

## Overview

This document tracks the parallel work for the internal Centric demo, where we showcase:
- Agent-driven planning and development
- Custom Copilot instructions and conventions
- Parallel development (C# code + Bicep infrastructure)
- Code review automation
- Pull request workflow

## Work Division

### Code Track (@shawnewallace)
**Responsibility:** Upgrade C# code to support Cosmos DB

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `CosmosDbTaskRepository` implementing `ITaskRepository`
- [ ] Add Cosmos DB configuration (appsettings.json)
- [ ] Update DI registration in ServiceExtensions
- [ ] Add NuGet packages (Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Write unit tests with mocked Cosmos client
- [ ] Write integration tests with Cosmos Emulator/Testcontainers
- [ ] Update README with configuration instructions

**Branch:** `feature/cosmos-db-repository` (from `demo/coi`)

---

### Infrastructure Track (@mdrakiburrahman)
**Responsibility:** Create Bicep templates for Azure infrastructure

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up `infra/` directory structure
- [ ] Create `main.bicep` for orchestration
- [ ] Create `cosmos.bicep` module
- [ ] Create App Service Bicep module
- [ ] Add parameter files (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Create `infra/README.md` with deployment instructions
- [ ] Test deployment to Azure

**Branch:** `feature/cosmos-db-infrastructure` (from `demo/coi`)

## Demo Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase (Agent Mode)

**Step 1: Fetch the GitHub Issue**
```
Use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode or Chat:
"Fetch GitHub issue #12 from centricconsulting/ai-coding-workshop and summarize the work required"
```

Expected AI actions:
- Calls GitHub API to retrieve issue details
- Parses acceptance criteria (code changes vs. infrastructure changes)
- Identifies assignees (@shawnewallace, @mcollier)
- Extracts technical requirements and implementation phases

**Step 2: Generate Implementation Plan**
```
"Based on issue #12, create a detailed step-by-step implementation plan for the C# code track.
Follow the Copilot instructions in .github/instructions/ for Clean Architecture and TDD."
```

Expected AI output:
- Phased approach (Setup → Repository → Testing → Infrastructure)
- Specific files to create/modify
- Test-first approach for each component
- Configuration and DI changes

**Step 3: Review and Refine**
- Review generated plan with team
- Adjust for demo timing and scope
- Assign tasks to parallel tracks (code vs. infrastructure)
- Create feature branches

### 2. Development Phase (Parallel Work)
- Shawn: Create feature branch and implement C# changes
- Michael: Create feature branch and implement Bicep changes
- Both: Leverage Copilot instructions for consistency
- Both: Use `/check` for automated code review

### 3. Review Phase (Code Review Automation)
- Run `/check` on completed code
- Request Copilot review on PRs
- Demonstrate custom review prompts
- Merge both PRs into `demo/coi`

### 4. Integration Phase
- Test integrated solution locally
- Deploy infrastructure with Bicep
- Validate API with Cosmos DB backend
- Document lessons learned

## Demo Highlights to Showcase

### Copilot Customizations
- **Repository-level instructions:** `.github/instructions/` (context-aware with `applyTo` patterns)
- **File-specific instructions:** Front matter in instruction files
- **Linked instruction files:** C# standards, Cosmos DB best practices, commit conventions

### Agent Capabilities
- **Planning mode:** Decompose work items into actionable steps
- **Code generation:** Generate boilerplate with proper conventions
- **Code review:** `/check` command for deep analysis
- **Multi-file editing:** Copilot Edits for cross-cutting changes

### Model Selection
- Demonstrate switching between models (GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet, etc.)
- Show auto-select vs. manual model choice
- Discuss cost-effectiveness and task suitability

### Parallel Development
- Two developers working on same feature simultaneously
- Clean separation of concerns (code vs. infrastructure)
- Integration via pull requests
- No merge conflicts due to good architecture

## Current Status

**Phase:** Planning  
**Next Steps:**
1. Review issue #12 with team
2. Use agent planning mode to create detailed implementation plan
3. Create feature branches for both tracks
4. Begin parallel development

## Notes

- This demo uses `demo/coi` as the "main" branch for the internal demonstration
- All PRs will target `demo/coi`, not the actual `main` branch
- Focus on showcasing best practices, not perfect implementation
- Emphasize team collaboration and AI-assisted development workflows
