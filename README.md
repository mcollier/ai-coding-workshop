# Workshop: Using AI for Application Development with GitHub Copilot (Bilingual Edition)

## Overview

Transform the way you build software with AI-powered development! This comprehensive workshop teaches developers how to leverage **GitHub Copilot** and modern AI coding assistants to accelerate application development while maintaining high code quality standards.

**Choose Your Technology Stack:** This workshop supports both **🔷 .NET** and **🟩 Spring Boot** implementations, allowing participants to learn AI-assisted development in their preferred ecosystem.

**This workshop is split into two parts:**

### Part 1: Fundamentals (3 hours)
Learn AI assistance across the entire development lifecycle—from requirements gathering to code generation, testing, and documentation. Using either **.NET 9** or **Spring Boot 3.x**, **Visual Studio Code**, and **GitHub Copilot**, you'll experience firsthand how AI can amplify developer productivity while following industry best practices like **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design**, and **Test-Driven Development**.

### Part 2: Advanced GitHub Copilot (3 hours)
Master advanced Copilot features including **interaction models** (Ask/Edit/Agent), **the Skills system**, **custom agents**, and **workflow automation**. Learn the complete customization hierarchy (Prompts → Instructions → Skills → Agents), discover capabilities with slash commands, and design production-ready agents that encode team knowledge and standardize AI-assisted development workflows.

**Full workshop duration:** 6 hours (can be delivered as separate sessions or combined)

**What makes this workshop unique:**
- **Bilingual support**: Choose .NET or Spring Boot—same concepts, your technology stack
- **Practical, hands-on labs** with real-world scenarios, not just demos
- **Complete customization hierarchy**: Instructions, Skills, and Agents working together
- **Enterprise-grade patterns** including Clean Architecture and DDD
- **TDD-first approach** with AI generating tests before implementation  
- **Pre-configured dev environment** via VS Code Dev Containers—no setup hassles (3 container options)
- **Repository-level Copilot instructions** with context-aware loading per technology stack
- **Skills exploration** with working examples (test-data-generator) showcasing domain knowledge without tool access
- **Production-ready agent design** including handoffs, invocation control, and governance patterns
- **Modern stacks**: .NET 9 with Minimal APIs and OpenTelemetry OR Spring Boot 3.x with actuators
- **Enterprise Java modernization scenarios**: Includes Mule ESB → Spring Boot refactoring examples

Whether you're new to AI-assisted development or looking to level up your Copilot skills, this workshop provides the practical experience and best practices you need to integrate AI into your daily workflow effectively.

This repository contains all workshop materials including lab guides, starter code, reference implementations, and facilitator resources.



## VS Code & Devcontainer Setup

For the best experience, use the provided **Devcontainer** and recommended VS Code settings:

- **Devcontainer Options** (choose based on your stack):
  - 🔷 **.NET Container** (`.devcontainer/dotnet/`): .NET 9 SDK, C# Dev Kit, xUnit extensions
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot Container** (`.devcontainer/springboot/`): Java 21 JDK, Spring Boot extensions, Maven
  - 🔷🟩 **Bilingual Container** (`.devcontainer/bilingual/`): Both .NET and Java environments (for facilitators or exploring both stacks)
- **Copilot Custom Instructions**: This repo auto-applies Copilot instructions based on file context:
  - 🔷 **.NET files** (`**/*.cs`): Loads `csharp.instructions.md` + `dotnet.instructions.md`
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot files** (`src-springboot/**`): Loads `springboot.instructions.md`
  - Instructions automatically load from `.github/instructions/` - no manual setup needed!

## Prerequisites

## Using the Dev Container (Recommended)

For a fully pre-configured development environment, you can use one of the included **Dev Containers**. This is the fastest way to get started and ensures all required tools and extensions are installed.

**How to use:**
1. Open this repository in VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. Select: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
4. **Choose your stack**:
   - 🔷 **.NET Developers**: Select `.devcontainer/dotnet/devcontainer.json`
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot Developers**: Select `.devcontainer/springboot/devcontainer.json`
   - 🔷🟩 **Both Stacks** (facilitators/explorers): Select `.devcontainer/bilingual/devcontainer.json`
5. VS Code will build and open the project in a container with all tools, SDKs, and extensions.

_This is optional but highly recommended, especially if you want to avoid manual environment setup or ensure consistency across all participants._

Before attending this workshop, participants should have:

**Universal Prerequisites:**
- **GitHub Copilot**: Active subscription and extension installed in VS Code
- **Visual Studio Code**: Latest version

- **C# Dev Kit extension** for VS Code
- **C# Experience**: Comfortable with basic C# syntax and concepts

**🟩 Spring Boot Track Prerequisites:**
- **Java 21 JDK**: Installed and verified with `java -version`
- **Maven or Gradle**: For building Spring Boot projects
- **Spring Boot extension pack** for VS Code
- **Java Experience**: Comfortable with basic Java syntax and Spring Framework concepts

### Environment Check

Run these commands to verify your setup:

**🔷 .NET Track:**
```bash
dotnet --version          # Should show 9.x.x
git --version            # Any recent version
code --version           # VS Code version
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/centricconsulting/ai-coding-workshop.git
   cd ai-coding-workshop
   ```

2. **Choose your technology stack**:
   - 🔷 **.NET Track**: Work in `src/` directory with .NET 9 projects
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot Track**: Work in `src-springboot/` directory with Spring Boot 3.x projects
   - 🔷🟩 **Explore Both**: Use bilingual devcontainer to try both ecosystems

3. **Create your own branch from `main`**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b my-workshop-branch
   ```
   _Replace `my-workshop-branch` with your name or a unique identifier._

4. **Open in VS Code and select DevContainer**:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```
   
   - When prompted, select "Reopen in Container"
   - **Choose your devcontainer**:
     - 🔷 `.devcontainer/dotnet/` for .NET track
     - 🟩 `.devcontainer/springboot/` for Spring Boot track
     - 🔷🟩 `.devcontainer/bilingual/` for both stacks

   **That's it!** Copilot instructions automatically load based on which files you're editing - no manual setup needed.

5. **Verify your environment**:

   **🔷 .NET Track:**
   ```bash
   dotnet --version    # Should show 9.x.x or later
   dotnet build        # Verify solution builds
   dotnet test         # Verify tests run
   ```

   **🟩 Spring Boot Track:**
   ```bash
   java -version       # Should show Java 21
   cd src-springboot
   mvn clean test      # Verify build and tests
   ```

6. **Ready to start!** Follow along with your facilitator or work through the labs independently

## Best Practices for Using Copilot, Skills & Agents

To get the most out of Copilot, Skills, and AI agents in this workshop:

- **Discover capabilities first**: Use `/help`, `/agents`, and `/skills` slash commands to explore what's available
- **Always ask for a plan first**: Use Copilot or Agent Mode to propose a step-by-step plan before making large or multi-file changes
- **Use Skills for knowledge**: Invoke skills like `#test-data-generator` for domain expertise and templates without needing file access
- **Use Agents for workflows**: Select custom agents like `@plan`, `@architect`, or `@architecture-reviewer` for multi-step tasks requiring tool access
- **Use the Check agent for code review**: Select the **Check** Copilot agent from the agents dropdown in Copilot Chat to get improvement suggestions before submitting a PR
- **Leverage chat participants**: Use `@workspace` for codebase questions, `@terminal` for CLI help, and `@vscode` for editor tips
- **Be explicit in prompts**: Reference files, selections, or context variables (e.g., `#file`, `#selection`) for targeted results
- **Review and iterate**: Treat Copilot suggestions as a starting point—review, refactor, and test as you would with any code

See the [Facilitator Guide](docs/FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md), [Customization Decision Guide](docs/guides/customization-decision-guide.md), and `.github/agents/Check.agent.md` for more workflow tips.
