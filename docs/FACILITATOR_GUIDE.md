  - VS Code open
  - GitHub Copilot enabled
  - .NET 9 SDK installed (`dotnet --version`)

   - Clone the repository and checkout the `main` branch:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/centricconsulting/ai-coding-workshop.git
      cd ai-coding-workshop
      git checkout main
      ```

- Open the repository in VS Code
- **Copilot Instructions are automatically active** via `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (no manual setup needed!)
- Verify build: `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`

---

## 0.5. GitHub Copilot Features Overview (0:15 – 0:30, 15 min)

**You do** - Quick tour of Copilot capabilities:

### **Inline Completions (Ghost Text)**

- As you type, Copilot suggests code in gray text
- Press `Tab` to accept, `Esc` to dismiss
- `Alt+]` / `Alt+[` to cycle through suggestions
- Works in comments, code, and tests

### **Copilot Chat Panel** (`Ctrl+Alt+I` or `Cmd+Shift+I`)

- Open chat interface for conversational coding
- Ask questions: *"How do I configure logging in .NET?"*
- Request code: *"Create a repository interface for Task entity"*
- Iterate on solutions without leaving VS Code

### **Inline Chat** (`Ctrl+I` or `Cmd+I`)

- Quick chat directly in your editor at cursor position
- Perfect for small edits: *"Add error handling"* or *"Make this method async"*
- Less context switching than full chat panel

### **Slash Commands** - Shortcuts for common tasks:

**Code Operations:**
- `/explain` - Understand code functionality
- `/fix` - Suggest fixes for errors or bugs
- `/tests` - Generate unit tests for selected code
- `/doc` - Create documentation comments
- `/refactor` - Improve code structure
- `/new` - Scaffold new files or projects

**Customization Commands:**
- `/init` - Initialize project with custom instructions
- `/create-agent` - Generate custom agent with AI
- `/create-skill` - Generate agent skill with AI
- `/create-instruction` - Generate instruction file with AI
- `/create-prompt` - Generate prompt file with AI
- `/create-hook` - Generate hook configuration with AI

**Navigation:**
- `/agents` - Open Configure Custom Agents menu
- `/skills` - Open Configure Skills menu
- `/clear` - Clear chat history


**Demo**: Show `/tests` on a method, `/explain` on complex code, `/init` for project setup

---
### 📝 Plan First with Agents (Demo)

**Goal:** Demonstrate how Copilot (in Agent Mode) or a custom agent like `@planner` can propose a step-by-step plan before any code is changed.

**How to show it:**
- In Copilot Chat (Agent Mode), ask: "Propose a step-by-step plan to refactor LegacyTaskProcessor to use async/await, add logging, and follow Object Calisthenics."
- Review the plan with the group. Edit or reorder steps as needed.
- Only then, ask Copilot (or `@engineer`) to implement the plan, step by step.

**Discussion:**
- Why is planning first valuable?
- Did the plan catch any issues or clarify the approach?
- How does this workflow compare to direct code generation?

**Tip:** Encourage participants to always ask for a plan before executing large or multi-file changes.


### **Agent Mode & MCP Tools**

**Agent Mode** allows Copilot to operate more autonomously, chaining together multiple steps, tools, and reasoning to solve complex tasks. This is especially powerful for:
- Multi-file or cross-cutting changes
- Automated codebase analysis or refactoring
- Running evaluation or test suites with minimal manual intervention
- Integrating with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools for advanced workflows

**MCP Tools** provide specialized capabilities (e.g., evaluation, tracing, agent orchestration) that can be invoked directly in Agent Mode. These tools enable:
- Automated evaluation of code or models
- Tracing and observability for AI workflows
- Agent-driven code generation and review

**How to use Agent Mode:**
1. Select "Agent" from the Copilot agents dropdown (or use the command palette).
2. Describe your goal in natural language (e.g., "Refactor all service classes to use async/await and add logging").
3. For advanced scenarios, reference MCP tools directly (e.g., "Evaluate this model using the aitk-evaluation_planner tool").
4. Review the proposed plan and results; iterate as needed.

**When to use Agent Mode:**
- When a task spans multiple files or requires orchestration
- For codebase-wide refactoring or analysis
- To automate repetitive or evaluation-heavy workflows
- When you want Copilot to propose and execute a plan, not just a single edit

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Encourage participants to try Agent Mode for at least one lab (e.g., Lab 3 or 4)
- Compare results from Ask/Edit vs. Agent Mode
- Demonstrate invoking an MCP tool (e.g., evaluation or tracing) and discuss the output

**Example prompt:**
> "Use Agent Mode to generate unit tests for all public methods in the Application layer, then run the tests and summarize the results."

---
### **Chat Participants (Agents)** - Specialized assistants:

- `@workspace` - Answers about your entire codebase
  - *"@workspace Where is the Task entity defined?"*
  - *"@workspace How is logging configured?"*
- `@vscode` - VS Code settings and commands
  - *"@vscode How do I change theme?"*
- `@terminal` - Terminal commands and shell help
  - *"@terminal How do I run tests in watch mode?"*
- `@azure` - Azure-specific guidance (if available)

**Demo**: Show `@workspace` finding code across solution

### **Context Variables** - Provide specific context:

- `#file` - Reference specific files
  - *"Refactor #file:TaskService.cs to use dependency injection"*
- `#selection` - Reference selected code
  - *"Add unit tests for #selection"*
- `#editor` - Current file context
- `#terminalSelection` - Selected terminal output

**Demo**: Select code, use `#selection` in chat

### **Copilot Edits** (Multi-file editing)

- Edit multiple files at once with AI guidance
- Add files to working set, describe changes
- Copilot proposes changes across all files
- Review and accept/reject changes

**Demo**: Add multiple files, request cross-cutting change

**Participants do (Quick practice)**:

1. Try inline completion by typing a method comment
2. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`), ask: *"What testing frameworks are used in this project?"*
3. Select a method, use Inline Chat (`Ctrl+I`): *"Add XML documentation"*
4. Try a slash command: `/explain` on any method
5. Use `@workspace`: *"@workspace Where is ITaskRepository implemented?"*

---

## 1. Controlling Context with Copilot Instructions (0:30 – 1:00, 30 min)

**You do**:

- Explain why *context matters* for Copilot output.
- Show the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in the repository.
- Explain that this file automatically configures Copilot for everyone working in this repo (no manual setup needed).
- **Emphasize Section 1: TDD Workflow** - "When asked to implement a feature, propose/emit tests before code"
- Show difference with/without instructions (e.g., generate a class, note coding style vs messy defaults).
- Highlight key instructions in the file:
  - **TDD first**: Write tests before implementation
  - Coding style (file-scoped namespaces, `nameof`, async/await, sealed classes)
  - Clean Architecture project layout (Domain/Application/Infrastructure/API)
  - DDD aggregates and value objects
  - Test rules (xUnit + FakeItEasy, organize by feature, class-per-method folders)
  - Conventional commits
  - OpenTelemetry for observability

**Participants do (Lab 1) - Following TDD Red-Green-Refactor**:

**Scenario**: Create a `NotificationService` that sends task notifications via email and SMS.

**Step 1: Create Interface First (Design)**

1. Ask Copilot Chat: *"Create an INotificationService interface in the Application layer for sending email and SMS notifications about tasks. Include methods for both individual and combined notifications."*
2. Review generated interface - should be in `src/TaskManager.Application/Services/INotificationService.cs`

**Step 2: Write Tests FIRST (Red)**

3. Ask Copilot: *"Create xUnit tests for NotificationService in the pattern specified in .github/copilot-instructions.md. Organize tests by method with separate test classes. Use FakeItEasy for mocking ILogger. Test happy path and all guard clauses."*
4. Review test structure: Should create folder `tests/TaskManager.UnitTests/Services/NotificationServiceTests/` with separate test classes per method
5. Run tests: `dotnet test` - **Tests should FAIL** (Red) because NotificationService doesn't exist yet

**Step 3: Implement Code (Green)**

6. Ask Copilot: *"Implement NotificationService that passes all the tests. Follow the coding style in .github/copilot-instructions.md: sealed class, file-scoped namespace, ILogger dependency injection, async/await, guard clauses with nameof."*

7. Review implementation - verify it follows all conventions:

- ✅ `sealed class`
- ✅ File-scoped namespace
- ✅ Constructor with `ILogger` and null check using `nameof`
- ✅ Async methods with proper `CancellationToken` support
- ✅ Guard clauses at method start (fail fast, no else)
- ✅ Structured logging with parameters

8. Run tests: `dotnet test` - **Tests should PASS** (Green)

**Step 4: Observe & Reflect (Refactor)**

9. Review the generated code quality:

   - Does it follow Clean Architecture (Application layer, no infrastructure concerns)?
   - Are test names descriptive?
   - Is the code intention-revealing?

10. Try asking Copilot: *"Are there any improvements we could make to this code?"*

**Key Learning Points to Emphasize**:

- ✅ **TDD enforces design thinking** - interface and tests force you to think about API before implementation
- ✅ **Copilot respects instructions** - consistent style across all generated code
- ✅ **Tests document behavior** - reading tests tells you exactly what the service does
- ✅ **Red-Green-Refactor cycle** - see tests fail, then pass, then improve
- ⚠️ **Don't skip the "Red" step** - if you write implementation first, you miss design feedback from tests

**Common Mistakes to Call Out**:

- ❌ Asking for implementation before tests (violates TDD)
- ❌ Not organizing tests by feature/method (makes tests hard to navigate)
- ❌ Accepting code without verifying it follows instructions
- ❌ Not running tests after each step

---

## 2. Requirements → Backlog → Code (1:00 – 1:45, 45 min)

**You do**:

- Introduce the idea: AI can turn **requirements → backlog items → tests → code**.
- Demo:  
  *User story:* *“As a user, I want to manage a list of tasks so I can track progress.”*  
  → Copilot generates backlog items (stories), acceptance criteria, test stubs.

**Participants do (Lab 2)**:

1. Write prompt: *“Generate 3 backlog items for a task manager, with acceptance criteria.”*
2. Pick one (e.g., Add Task).
3. Generate a unit test skeleton in xUnit for `AddTask`.
4. Implement `TaskService.AddTask` with Copilot.
5. Run `dotnet test` → verify.

---

## 3. Code Generation & Refactoring in .NET (1:45 – 2:30, 45 min)

**You do**:

- Show Copilot scaffolding: create a `TasksController` with minimal API.
- Show refactor of messy method (provided in repo):
  - Before: long function, nested ifs, poor naming
  - After: Copilot helps split into smaller methods, add async, ILogger logging.

**Participants do (Lab 3)**:

1. Use `@workspace` to understand the API structure: *"@workspace Show me the API endpoint extensions"*
2. Scaffold minimal Web API endpoints using Chat:
   - `GET /tasks/{id}` - *"Implement the GetTaskByIdAsync endpoint in EndpointExtensions"*
   - `POST /tasks` - Use inline chat (`Ctrl+I`) with `#file:EndpointExtensions.cs`
3. Use `/refactor` on the `LegacyTaskProcessor.ProcessTaskBatch` method:
   - Select the method, Chat: `/refactor enforce guard clauses and add async`
   - Or use Inline Chat: *"Refactor this to use async/await and add logging"*
4. Use `/tests` on refactored code to generate unit tests
5. Re-run `dotnet build && dotnet test`.

---

## 4. Testing, Documentation, Workflow (2:30 – 2:45, 15 min)

**You do**:

- Show Copilot generating:
  - xUnit tests using `/tests` command
  - README docs using `/doc` command
  - Commit message using Chat with staged changes context
  - PR summary with `@workspace` for full context

**Participants do (Lab 4)**:

1. Select a method in `TaskService`, use `/tests` to generate xUnit tests
2. Use `/doc` to generate XML documentation for a class or method
3. Stage changes (`git add`), then use Chat: *"Write a Conventional Commit message for these staged changes"*
4. Ask Chat: *"@workspace Draft a PR description including intent, scope, and risks for the changes I made"*
5. Generate a README section: *"Create a Getting Started section for the API in #file:README.md"*

---

## 5. Wrap-Up & Discussion (2:45 – 3:00, 15 min)

**You do**:

- Recap: where Copilot helped (backlog shaping, scaffolding, refactoring, testing, docs, workflow).
- Call out **anti-patterns**:
  - Prompt roulette (unversioned prompts, inconsistent results)
  - Over-trusting Copilot without tests
  - Letting AI sneak domain logic into API layer
- Next steps:
  - Standardize Copilot Instructions in team repos
  - Build shared prompt/playbook library
  - Apply to real legacy code modernization

**Participants do**:

- Share takeaways.
- Ask Q&A: where would they use this tomorrow?

---

### Teaching Chat Participants & Agents in the Workshop

#### **Section 0.5 (Copilot Features Tour)**

**Demo Strategy** (5-7 minutes on participants and agents):

1. **Show Default Chat**:

   ```text
   What is the repository pattern?
   ```

   → Generic explanation

2. **Compare with @workspace**:

   ```text
   @workspace Where is the repository pattern implemented?
   ```

   → Specific file locations in YOUR project

3. **Show the Difference**:
   - Default: Generic, educational
   - @workspace: Specific, actionable

4. **Quick @terminal Demo**:

   ```text
   @terminal How do I run tests with detailed output?
   ```

   → Shows actual commands for their environment

#### **Throughout Labs - Usage Guide**

| Lab | Recommended Tools | When to Use |
|-----|------------------|-------------|
| **Lab 1** | Default, @workspace, Plan agent | Concepts, finding test patterns, planning tests |
| **Lab 2** | @workspace, Default, Architect agent | Finding entities, understanding layers, planning features |
| **Lab 3** | @workspace, @terminal, Check agent | Finding endpoints, refactoring commands, code review |
| **Lab 4** | @workspace, @terminal, Check agent | Git commands, understanding test structure, PR review |

#### **Common Participant Mistakes**

1. **Using Default Instead of @workspace**:
   - **Mistake**: "Where is the Task entity?"
   - **Better**: "@workspace Where is the Task entity?"
   - **Result**: Specific file path vs. generic explanation

2. **Using @workspace for Concepts**:
   - **Mistake**: "@workspace What is dependency injection?"
   - **Better**: "What is dependency injection?" (default)
   - **Result**: Educational explanation vs. code search

3. **Not Using @terminal for Commands**:
   - **Mistake**: "How do I run tests?"
   - **Better**: "@terminal How do I run tests?"
   - **Result**: Generic vs. environment-specific commands

4. **Not Using Custom Agents for Specialized Tasks**:
   - **Mistake**: Asking default chat to review code
   - **Better**: Select **Check** agent from dropdown for code review
   - **Result**: Generic feedback vs. structured review following project standards

5. **Not Using Plan Agent Before Big Changes**:
   - **Mistake**: Diving into implementation without planning
   - **Better**: Select **Plan** agent to develop strategy first
   - **Result**: Ad-hoc changes vs. comprehensive, thought-out approach

---

### Advanced Tips for Facilitators

#### **Combining Chat Participants and Custom Agents**

You can use chat participants and custom agents in sequence:

1. **Understand concept** (Default):

   ```text
   Explain the CQRS pattern
   ```

2. **Find in code** (@workspace):

   ```text
   @workspace Show me examples of commands and queries in this project
   ```

3. **Review code** (Check agent):

   Select **Check** agent from dropdown:
   ```text
   Review the command handlers for best practices
   ```

4. **Run tests** (@terminal):

   ```text
   @terminal Run tests for the command handlers
   ```

#### **Context Variables with Participants and Agents**

Combine chat participants and agents with context variables for precision:

```text
@workspace What tests exist for #file:CreateTaskCommandHandler.cs?
```

```text
@terminal How do I run tests in #file:CreateTaskCommandHandlerTests.cs?
```

With custom agents:
```text
[Select Check agent] Review #file:TaskService.cs for improvements
```

#### **When Participants and Agents Don't Help**

Sometimes participants need to:

- **Read documentation**: Point them to official docs
- **Debug interactively**: Use VS Code debugger
- **Review logs**: Look at actual error messages
- **Ask human experts**: Some questions need human judgment

### Troubleshooting

#### **@workspace Not Finding Code**

**Symptoms**: Says "I couldn't find..." for code that exists

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure all relevant files are in workspace (not excluded)
2. Wait for indexing to complete (check bottom status bar)
3. Reload window: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
4. Try being more specific: include file names or paths

#### **Custom Agents Not Appearing**

**Symptoms**: Custom agents not showing in dropdown

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure `.agent.md` files are in `.github/agents/` directory
2. Files must have proper `chatagent` frontmatter
3. Reload VS Code window: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
4. Check VS Code is version 1.106 or later

#### **Chat Participants Not Available**

**Symptoms**: @azure or other participants don't work

**Solutions**:

1. Check Copilot extension version (update if needed)
2. Verify subscription includes advanced features
3. Some modes require specific extensions installed
4. Try restarting VS Code

#### **Wrong Mode Selected**

**Symptoms**: Generic answers when you wanted specific ones

**Solutions**:

1. Check which mode you're using (shown in chat)
2. Rephrase with explicit mode: "@workspace [question]"
3. Clear chat and start over with correct mode

**5-Minute Hands-On** (during Section 0.5):

Ask participants to try each mode:

1. **Default Chat**:

   ```text
   What is Test-Driven Development?
   ```

   *Expected*: Conceptual explanation of TDD

2. **@workspace**:

   ```text
   @workspace Where are the xUnit tests located?
   ```

   *Expected*: Actual file paths in their project

3. **@terminal**:

   ```text
   @terminal Show me the command to build and test
   ```

   *Expected*: `dotnet build && dotnet test` or similar

4. **@vscode**:

   ```text
   @vscode How do I toggle the terminal?
   ```

   *Expected*: Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+\` or Cmd+\`)

**Debrief**:

- Which mode gave the most useful answer for each question?
- When would you use each mode during the labs?

### Key Takeaways for Facilitators

✅ **@workspace is most important** for this workshop - emphasize it!  
✅ **Default chat** is good for learning concepts  
✅ **@terminal** helps with .NET CLI commands  
✅ **Modes are contextual** - teach when to use which  
✅ **Practice makes perfect** - participants learn by using them  

**Don't Overwhelm**:

- Focus on @workspace and default chat primarily
- Introduce other modes as needed during labs
- Reference this appendix for detailed explanations
- Let participants discover advanced usage naturally
