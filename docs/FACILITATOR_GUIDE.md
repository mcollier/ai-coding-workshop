# This document provides a detailed facilitator's guide for running the 3-hour workshop.

## Timing and Flow Tips

- **Keep labs hands-on**: Minimize lecture time, maximize coding time
- **Walking around**: Circulate during labs to help with issues
- **Backup plans**: Have pre-built examples ready if participants struggle
- **Flex time**: Each section has 5-10 minutes of flex time built in
- **Energy management**: Take 5-minute breaks between major sections
- **Advanced participants**: Have optional extension exercises ready
- **Copilot Instructions**: Repository uses `.github/instructions/` with context-aware `applyTo` patterns - no manual setup required by participants!
- **Dual-Stack Delivery**:
  - **Homogeneous groups** (.NET only or Java only): Timing estimates remain unchanged
  - **Mixed groups** (.NET and Java together): Add 5-10 minutes to Labs 1-3 for cross-stack comparison discussions
  - Labs 4-10 are mostly stack-agnostic - no timing adjustments needed

Facilitator's Guide: Using AI for Application Development with GitHub Copilot (Bilingual Edition: .NET & Spring Boot)

This document provides a detailed facilitator's guide for running the 3-hour workshop with support for both .NET and Spring Boot technology stacks.


## 0. Kickoff & Setup (0:00 – 0:15, 15 min)

**You do**:

- Welcome participants, introduce goals: *"We'll learn how to use AI (Copilot) to help with requirements, code, tests, docs, and workflow in software projects using either .NET or Spring Boot."*
- **Poll the room**: Ask participants to raise hands for .NET vs Spring Boot (helps gauge group composition)
- Explain **Copilot Instructions** concept and context-aware instruction loading (`.github/instructions/` with `applyTo` patterns).
- Quick demo: show that instructions automatically load based on file context:
  - 🔷 **.NET**: Files matching `**/*.cs` → `csharp.instructions.md` and `dotnet.instructions.md`
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: Files matching `src-springboot/**` → `springboot.instructions.md`

- **Present:** Use the **[Modular Presentations](./presentations/modules/part1/)** (Marp format) to guide Part 1
  - [Part 1 Module Catalog](./presentations/index.md#part-1-fundamentals-3-hours) - 7 standalone modules
  - View with Marp VS Code extension or export to PDF
  - Modules cover all labs with talking points
  - **Archived:** [Legacy monolithic presentation](../archive/presentations/fundamentals-github-copilot.md) available for reference

**Participants do**:

- Confirm environment:
  - VS Code open
  - GitHub Copilot enabled
  - **🔷 .NET**: .NET 9 SDK installed (`dotnet --version`)
  - **🟩 Spring Boot**: Java 21 JDK installed (`java -version`), Maven/Gradle

- Clone the repository and checkout the `main` branch:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/centricconsulting/ai-coding-workshop.git
  cd ai-coding-workshop
  git checkout main
  ```

- **Select DevContainer** based on your technology stack:
  - 🔷 **.NET Participants**: "Reopen in Container" → Choose `.devcontainer/dotnet/devcontainer.json`
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot Participants**: "Reopen in Container" → Choose `.devcontainer/springboot/devcontainer.json`
  - 🔷🟩 **Both Stacks** (facilitators/explorers): Choose `.devcontainer/bilingual/devcontainer.json`

- **Copilot Instructions automatically load** based on file context via `.github/instructions/` (no manual setup needed!)

- **Verify build**:
  - 🔷 **.NET**: `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` in project root
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: `cd src-springboot && mvn clean test`

---

## 0.1. Tech Stack Selection & Group Composition (After Setup, 5 min)

**You do**:

- **For Homogeneous Groups (.NET only OR Java only)**:
  - Simplify delivery: focus on one technology stack throughout
  - Skip "dual-stack" explanations and comparisons
  - Lab materials support both tracks independently
  - Emphasize stack-specific Copilot Instructions file (`.github/instructions/dotnet.instructions.md` or `springboot.instructions.md`)

- **For Mixed Groups (.NET AND Java together)**:
  - Explain **bilingual format** with 🔷 .NET and 🟩 Spring Boot markers
  - Encourage cross-pollination: ".NET devs can learn from Java patterns and vice versa"
  - Pair mixed-stack participants during labs for knowledge sharing
  - **Labs 1-3**: Significant stack-specific content (separate files or bilingual sections)
  - **Labs 4-10**: Mostly stack-agnostic (agent concepts, testing philosophy)

- **For Enterprise Java Teams Modernizing from Mule ESB**:
  - Reference [Pattern Translation Guide](guides/pattern-translation-guide.md) for Mule → Spring Boot mappings
  - Highlight **Lab 3** refactoring scenarios (includes Mule ESB legacy code examples)
  - Mention modernization agent (#20 - in development) for Mule → Spring Boot transformation assistance
  - Emphasize Cost of Delay for legacy integration platforms

**Participants do**:

- Confirm their chosen stack and verify devcontainer selection
- Open a sample file in their stack to see Copilot Instructions load:
  - 🔷 **.NET**: Open any `.cs` file → see csharp.instructions.md and dotnet.instructions.md activate
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: Open any file in `src-springboot/` → see springboot.instructions.md activate

---

## 0.5. GitHub Copilot Features Overview (0:15 – 0:30, 15 min)

**You do** - Quick tour of Copilot capabilities:

### **Inline Completions (Ghost Text)**

- As you type, Copilot suggests code in gray text
- Press `Tab` to accept, `Esc` to dismiss
- `Alt+]` / `Alt+[` to cycle through suggestions
- Works in comments, code, and tests

### **Copilot Chat Panel** (`Ctrl+Alt+I` or `Cmd+Shift+I`)

- Open chat interface for conversational coding
- Ask questions: *"How do I configure logging in .NET?"*
- Request code: *"Create a repository interface for Task entity"*
- Iterate on solutions without leaving VS Code

### **Inline Chat** (`Ctrl+I` or `Cmd+I`)

- Quick chat directly in your editor at cursor position
- Perfect for small edits: *"Add error handling"* or *"Make this method async"*
- Less context switching than full chat panel

### **Slash Commands** - Shortcuts for common tasks:

**Code Operations:**
- `/explain` - Understand code functionality
- `/fix` - Suggest fixes for errors or bugs
- `/tests` - Generate unit tests for selected code
- `/doc` - Create documentation comments
- `/refactor` - Improve code structure
- `/new` - Scaffold new files or projects

**Customization Commands:**
- `/init` - Initialize project with custom instructions
- `/create-agent` - Generate custom agent with AI
- `/create-skill` - Generate agent skill with AI
- `/create-instruction` - Generate instruction file with AI
- `/create-prompt` - Generate prompt file with AI
- `/create-hook` - Generate hook configuration with AI

**Navigation:**
- `/agents` - Open Configure Custom Agents menu
- `/skills` - Open Configure Skills menu
- `/clear` - Clear chat history


**Demo**: Show `/tests` on a method, `/explain` on complex code, `/init` for project setup

---
### 📝 Plan First with Agents (Demo)

**Goal:** Demonstrate how Copilot (in Agent Mode) or a custom agent like `@planner` can propose a step-by-step plan before any code is changed.

**How to show it:**
- In Copilot Chat (Agent Mode), ask: "Propose a step-by-step plan to refactor LegacyTaskProcessor to use async/await, add logging, and follow Object Calisthenics."
- Review the plan with the group. Edit or reorder steps as needed.
- Only then, ask Copilot (or `@engineer`) to implement the plan, step by step.

**Discussion:**
- Why is planning first valuable?
- Did the plan catch any issues or clarify the approach?
- How does this workflow compare to direct code generation?

**Tip:** Encourage participants to always ask for a plan before executing large or multi-file changes.


### **Agent Mode & MCP Tools**

**Agent Mode** allows Copilot to operate more autonomously, chaining together multiple steps, tools, and reasoning to solve complex tasks. This is especially powerful for:
- Multi-file or cross-cutting changes
- Automated codebase analysis or refactoring
- Running evaluation or test suites with minimal manual intervention
- Integrating with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools for advanced workflows

**MCP Tools** provide specialized capabilities (e.g., evaluation, tracing, agent orchestration) that can be invoked directly in Agent Mode. These tools enable:
- Automated evaluation of code or models
- Tracing and observability for AI workflows
- Agent-driven code generation and review

**How to use Agent Mode:**
1. Select "Agent" from the Copilot agents dropdown (or use the command palette).
2. Describe your goal in natural language (e.g., "Refactor all service classes to use async/await and add logging").
3. For advanced scenarios, reference MCP tools directly (e.g., "Evaluate this model using the aitk-evaluation_planner tool").
4. Review the proposed plan and results; iterate as needed.

**When to use Agent Mode:**
- When a task spans multiple files or requires orchestration
- For codebase-wide refactoring or analysis
- To automate repetitive or evaluation-heavy workflows
- When you want Copilot to propose and execute a plan, not just a single edit

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Encourage participants to try Agent Mode for at least one lab (e.g., Lab 3 or 4)
- Compare results from Ask/Edit vs. Agent Mode
- Demonstrate invoking an MCP tool (e.g., evaluation or tracing) and discuss the output

**Example prompt:**
> "Use Agent Mode to generate unit tests for all public methods in the Application layer, then run the tests and summarize the results."

---
### **Chat Participants (Agents)** - Specialized assistants:

- `@workspace` - Answers about your entire codebase
  - *"@workspace Where is the Task entity defined?"*
  - *"@workspace How is logging configured?"*
- `@vscode` - VS Code settings and commands
  - *"@vscode How do I change theme?"*
- `@terminal` - Terminal commands and shell help
  - *"@terminal How do I run tests in watch mode?"*
- `@azure` - Azure-specific guidance (if available)

**Demo**: Show `@workspace` finding code across solution

### **Context Variables** - Provide specific context:

- `#file` - Reference specific files
  - *"Refactor #file:TaskService.cs to use dependency injection"*
- `#selection` - Reference selected code
  - *"Add unit tests for #selection"*
- `#editor` - Current file context
- `#terminalSelection` - Selected terminal output

**Demo**: Select code, use `#selection` in chat

### **Copilot Edits** (Multi-file editing)

- Edit multiple files at once with AI guidance
- Add files to working set, describe changes
- Copilot proposes changes across all files
- Review and accept/reject changes

**Demo**: Add multiple files, request cross-cutting change

**Participants do (Quick practice)**:

1. Try inline completion by typing a method comment
2. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`), ask: *"What testing frameworks are used in this project?"*
3. Select a method, use Inline Chat (`Ctrl+I`): *"Add XML documentation"*
4. Try a slash command: `/explain` on any method
5. Use `@workspace`: *"@workspace Where is ITaskRepository implemented?"*

---

## 1. Controlling Context with Copilot Instructions (0:30 – 1:00, 30 min)

**You do**:

- Explain why *context matters* for Copilot output.
- **Show stack-specific instructions**:
  - 🔷 **.NET**: `.github/instructions/dotnet.instructions.md` (loaded for `.cs` files)
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: `.github/instructions/springboot.instructions.md` (loaded for `src-springboot/**`)
- Explain that instruction files automatically load based on file patterns (no manual setup needed).
- **Emphasize Section 1: TDD Workflow** - "When asked to implement a feature, propose/emit tests before code"
- Show difference with/without instructions (e.g., generate a class, note coding style vs messy defaults).
- **Highlight key instructions** common to both stacks:
  - **TDD first**: Write tests before implementation
  - Clean Architecture project layout (Domain/Application/Infrastructure/API)
  - DDD aggregates and value objects
  - Conventional commits
- **Stack-specific patterns**:
  - 🔷 **.NET**: File-scoped namespaces, `nameof`, async/await, sealed classes, xUnit + FakeItEasy, OpenTelemetry
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: @Service/@Repository, @Slf4j, Optional types, JUnit 5 + Mockito, Spring Boot Actuator

**Participants do (Lab 1) - Following TDD Red-Green-Refactor**:

> **Note for Facilitators**: [Lab 01](labs/lab-01-tdd-with-copilot.md) is **bilingual** with 🔷 .NET and 🟩 Spring Boot sections throughout. Participants work through their chosen stack's examples.

**Scenario**: Create a `NotificationService` that sends task notifications via email and SMS.

**High-Level Steps** (details in lab file):

1. **Create Interface First** (Design)
   - 🔷 **.NET**: `INotificationService` in `src/TaskManager.Application/Services/`
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: `NotificationService` interface in `notification` package

2. **Write Tests FIRST** (Red)
   - 🔷 **.NET**: xUnit tests with FakeItEasy mocking, organized by method in class-per-method folders
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: JUnit 5 tests with Mockito, organized by feature in test classes
   - Run tests → Should FAIL (Red phase)

3. **Implement Code** (Green)
   - 🔷 **.NET**: Sealed class, file-scoped namespace, async/await, guard clauses, structured logging
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: @Service annotation, constructor injection, @Slf4j, Optional handling
   - Run tests → Should PASS (Green phase)

4. **Observe & Reflect** (Refactor)
   - Review code quality and adherence to instructions
   - Ask Copilot for improvement suggestions

**Key Learning Points to Emphasize** (universal across stacks):

- ✅ **TDD enforces design thinking** - interface and tests force you to think about API before implementation
- ✅ **Copilot respects instructions** - consistent style across all generated code
- ✅ **Tests document behavior** - reading tests tells you exactly what the service does
- ✅ **Red-Green-Refactor cycle** - see tests fail, then pass, then improve
- ⚠️ **Don't skip the "Red" step** - if you write implementation first, you miss design feedback from tests

**Common Mistakes to Call Out**:

- ❌ Asking for implementation before tests (violates TDD)
- ❌ Not organizing tests by feature/method (makes tests hard to navigate)
- ❌ Accepting code without verifying it follows instructions
- ❌ Not running tests after each step

---

## 2. Requirements → Backlog → Code (1:00 – 1:45, 45 min)

**You do**:

- Introduce the idea: AI can turn **requirements → backlog items → tests → code**.
- Demo:  
  *User story:* *“As a user, I want to manage a list of tasks so I can track progress.”*  
  → Copilot generates backlog items (stories), acceptance criteria, test stubs.

**Participants do (Lab 2)**:

> **Note for Facilitators**: Lab 02 has **separate files** for each stack:
> - 🔷 **.NET**: [lab-02-requirements-to-code.md](labs/lab-02-requirements-to-code.md)
> - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: [lab-02-requirements-to-code-java.md](labs/lab-02-requirements-to-code-java.md)

**High-Level Steps** (participants follow their stack's lab file):

1. Generate backlog items from user story: *"As a user, I want to manage a list of tasks so I can track progress."*
2. Use **Backlog Generator agent** (optional) or manual prompting
3. Pick one backlog item (e.g., Add Task, Update Task status)
4. Generate unit test skeleton following TDD
   - 🔷 **.NET**: xUnit test for `TaskService.AddTask`
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: JUnit 5 test for `TaskService.createTask`
5. Implement the service method with Copilot
6. Run tests and verify
7. Implement API endpoint (Minimal API vs @RestController)

**Key Point**: Both stacks follow CQRS pattern - emphasize separation of commands and queries

---

## 3. Code Generation & Refactoring (1:45 – 2:30, 45 min)

**You do**:

- Show Copilot scaffolding for REST API endpoints
  - 🔷 **.NET**: Create `TasksController` with minimal API style
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: Create `TaskController` with @RestController
- Show refactor of messy legacy code (provided in repo):
  - Before: long function, nested ifs, poor naming, synchronous operations
  - After: Copilot helps split into smaller methods, add async, structured logging

**Participants do (Lab 3)**:

> **Note for Facilitators**: Lab 03 has **separate files** for each stack:
> - 🔷 **.NET**: [lab-03-generation-and-refactoring.md](labs/lab-03-generation-and-refactoring.md)
> - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: [lab-03-generation-and-refactoring-java.md](labs/lab-03-generation-and-refactoring-java.md)

**High-Level Steps** (participants follow their stack's lab file):

**Part A: REST API Generation**
1. Generate REST API endpoints for Task CRUD operations
2. Follow stack patterns:
   - 🔷 **.NET**: Minimal APIs with route groups, async/await, CancellationToken
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: @RestController with @GetMapping/@PostMapping, ResponseEntity
3. Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

**Part B: Legacy Code Refactoring**
1. Refactor provided legacy code (LegacyTaskProcessor)
2. Apply Object Calisthenics rules:
   - One level of indentation
   - No else keyword
   - Wrap primitive types
   - First-class collections
3. **🟩 Spring Boot Bonus**: Mule ESB → Spring Boot refactoring example (see lab file)

**Key Point for Enterprise Java Teams**: Lab 3 includes Mule ESB modernization scenarios - legacy DataWeave transformations → Spring Boot services

---

## 4. Testing, Documentation, Workflow (2:30 – 2:45, 15 min)

**You do**:

- Show Copilot generating:
  - Unit tests using `/tests` command
    - 🔷 **.NET**: xUnit tests with FakeItEasy
    - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: JUnit 5 tests with Mockito
  - Documentation using `/doc` command (language-agnostic)
  - Commit message using Chat with staged changes context
  - PR summary with `@workspace` for full context

**Participants do (Lab 4)**:

> **Note for Facilitators**: Lab 04 is currently **.NET-focused** ([lab-04-testing-documentation-workflow.md](labs/lab-04-testing-documentation-workflow.md)). Spring Boot version is planned.\n> Core concepts (testing philosophy, documentation, workflow) apply to both stacks.

**High-Level Steps** (mostly stack-agnostic):

1. **Generate tests**: Select a method, use `/tests` command
   - 🔷 **.NET**: Generates xUnit + FakeItEasy tests
   - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: Generates JUnit 5 + Mockito tests (manual prompting if lab not available)
2. **Generate documentation**: Use `/doc` to create inline docs (XML docs / JavaDoc)
3. **Conventional commits**: Stage changes, ask Chat for commit message following Conventional Commits
4. **PR descriptions**: Use `@workspace` to draft PR summary with intent, scope, and risks
5. **README generation**: Ask for Getting Started section in README.md

---

## 5. Wrap-Up & Discussion (2:45 – 3:00, 15 min)

**You do**:

- Recap: where Copilot helped (backlog shaping, scaffolding, refactoring, testing, docs, workflow).
- Call out **anti-patterns**:
  - Prompt roulette (unversioned prompts, inconsistent results)
  - Over-trusting Copilot without tests
  - Letting AI sneak domain logic into API layer
- Next steps:
  - Standardize Copilot Instructions in team repos
  - Build shared prompt/playbook library
  - Apply to real legacy code modernization

**Participants do**:

- Share takeaways.
- Ask Q&A: where would they use this tomorrow?

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Copilot Not Working

- **Check subscription**: Verify active GitHub Copilot subscription
- **Extension enabled**: Ensure Copilot extension is installed and enabled in VS Code
- **Authentication**: Sign out and back in to GitHub in VS Code
- **Instructions not loading**:
  - Ensure you're working in the repository root (where `.github/` folder exists)
  - Verify `.github/instructions/` directory contains instruction files with `applyTo:` frontmatter
  - Reload VS Code window: `F1` → "Developer: Reload Window"
  - Try Command Palette → "GitHub Copilot: Restart Language Server"

### .NET Build Issues

- **Wrong version**: Ensure .NET 9 SDK is installed (`dotnet --version`)
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `dotnet restore` in project directory
- **Path issues**: Use absolute paths or ensure correct working directory

### Spring Boot Build Issues

- **Wrong Java version**: Ensure Java 21 JDK is installed (`java -version`)
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `mvn clean install` or `./gradlew build` in `src-springboot/` directory
- **Port conflicts**: Application may fail to start if port 8080 is in use - check `application.properties`
- **DevContainer issues**: Ensure you selected the correct devcontainer (`.devcontainer/springboot/` or `.devcontainer/bilingual/`)
- **Maven wrapper**: Use `./mvnw` instead of `mvn` if Maven is not globally installed

### Copilot Generating Wrong Code

- **Check instructions**: Verify workshop instructions are properly configured
  - 🔷 **.NET**: Verify `csharp.instructions.md` and `dotnet.instructions.md` load for `.cs` files
  - 🟩 **Spring Boot**: Verify `springboot.instructions.md` loads for files in `src-springboot/`
- **Context matters**: Include relevant files in VS Code workspace
- **Prompt clarity**: Be specific about requirements and constraints
  - Include stack in prompt: "Generate a Spring Boot @RestController" vs "Generate a .NET Minimal API"
- **Restart Copilot**: Command Palette → "GitHub Copilot: Restart Language Server"
- **Wrong patterns**: If Copilot generates .NET code when you want Java (or vice versa):
  - Open a file in the correct stack's directory (`src-springboot/` for Java, `src/` for .NET)
  - Include stack-specific keywords in prompts (@Service, JUnit 5, Mockito vs sealed, xUnit, FakeItEasy)

---

## Deliverables Recap

- **Repo**: Clean Architecture solution with Domain/Application/Infrastructure/API layers in the `main` branch
- **Copilot Instructions**: `.github/instructions/` (context-aware files with `applyTo` patterns, automatically loaded)
- **Documentation**:
  - Main README with workshop outline
  - Facilitator's Guide (this document)
  - Detailed Lab Walkthroughs in `docs/labs/`
  - Starter Projects README with architecture details
- **Code Examples**: Console app, Web API with OpenTelemetry, legacy code for refactoring (LegacyTaskProcessor)
- **Test Infrastructure**: xUnit test stubs with FakeItEasy ready for participants

### Teaching Chat Participants & Agents in the Workshop

#### **Section 0.5 (Copilot Features Tour)**

**Demo Strategy** (5-7 minutes on participants and agents):

1. **Show Default Chat**:

   ```text
   What is the repository pattern?
   ```

   → Generic explanation

2. **Compare with @workspace**:

   ```text
   @workspace Where is the repository pattern implemented?
   ```

   → Specific file locations in YOUR project

3. **Show the Difference**:
   - Default: Generic, educational
   - @workspace: Specific, actionable

4. **Quick @terminal Demo**:

   ```text
   @terminal How do I run tests with detailed output?
   ```

   → Shows actual commands for their environment

#### **Throughout Labs - Usage Guide**

| Lab | Recommended Tools | When to Use |
|-----|------------------|-------------|
| **Lab 1** | Default, @workspace, Plan agent | Concepts, finding test patterns, planning tests |
| **Lab 2** | @workspace, Default, Architect agent | Finding entities, understanding layers, planning features |
| **Lab 3** | @workspace, @terminal, Check agent | Finding endpoints, refactoring commands, code review |
| **Lab 4** | @workspace, @terminal, Check agent | Git commands, understanding test structure, PR review |

#### **Common Participant Mistakes**

1. **Using Default Instead of @workspace**:
   - **Mistake**: "Where is the Task entity?"
   - **Better**: "@workspace Where is the Task entity?"
   - **Result**: Specific file path vs. generic explanation

2. **Using @workspace for Concepts**:
   - **Mistake**: "@workspace What is dependency injection?"
   - **Better**: "What is dependency injection?" (default)
   - **Result**: Educational explanation vs. code search

3. **Not Using @terminal for Commands**:
   - **Mistake**: "How do I run tests?"
   - **Better**: "@terminal How do I run tests?"
   - **Result**: Generic vs. environment-specific commands

4. **Not Using Custom Agents for Specialized Tasks**:
   - **Mistake**: Asking default chat to review code
   - **Better**: Select **Check** agent from dropdown for code review
   - **Result**: Generic feedback vs. structured review following project standards

5. **Not Using Plan Agent Before Big Changes**:
   - **Mistake**: Diving into implementation without planning
   - **Better**: Select **Plan** agent to develop strategy first
   - **Result**: Ad-hoc changes vs. comprehensive, thought-out approach

### Advanced Tips for Facilitators

#### **Combining Chat Participants and Custom Agents**

You can use chat participants and custom agents in sequence:

1. **Understand concept** (Default):

   ```text
   Explain the CQRS pattern
   ```

2. **Find in code** (@workspace):

   ```text
   @workspace Show me examples of commands and queries in this project
   ```

3. **Review code** (Check agent):

   Select **Check** agent from dropdown:
   ```text
   Review the command handlers for best practices
   ```

4. **Run tests** (@terminal):

   ```text
   @terminal Run tests for the command handlers
   ```

#### **Context Variables with Participants and Agents**

Combine chat participants and agents with context variables for precision:

```text
@workspace What tests exist for #file:CreateTaskCommandHandler.cs?
```

```text
@terminal How do I run tests in #file:CreateTaskCommandHandlerTests.cs?
```

With custom agents:
```text
[Select Check agent] Review #file:TaskService.cs for improvements
```

#### **When Participants and Agents Don't Help**

Sometimes participants need to:

- **Read documentation**: Point them to official docs
- **Debug interactively**: Use VS Code debugger
- **Review logs**: Look at actual error messages
- **Ask human experts**: Some questions need human judgment

### Troubleshooting

#### **@workspace Not Finding Code**

**Symptoms**: Says "I couldn't find..." for code that exists

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure all relevant files are in workspace (not excluded)
2. Wait for indexing to complete (check bottom status bar)
3. Reload window: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
4. Try being more specific: include file names or paths

#### **Custom Agents Not Appearing**

**Symptoms**: Custom agents not showing in dropdown

**Solutions**:

1. Ensure `.agent.md` files are in `.github/agents/` directory
2. Files must have proper `chatagent` frontmatter
3. Reload VS Code window: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
4. Check VS Code is version 1.106 or later

#### **Chat Participants Not Available**

**Symptoms**: @azure or other participants don't work

**Solutions**:

1. Check Copilot extension version (update if needed)
2. Verify subscription includes advanced features
3. Some modes require specific extensions installed
4. Try restarting VS Code

#### **Wrong Mode Selected**

**Symptoms**: Generic answers when you wanted specific ones

**Solutions**:

1. Check which mode you're using (shown in chat)
2. Rephrase with explicit mode: "@workspace [question]"
3. Clear chat and start over with correct mode

---

### Practice Exercise for Participants

**5-Minute Hands-On** (during Section 0.5):

Ask participants to try each mode:

1. **Default Chat**:

   ```text
   What is Test-Driven Development?
   ```

   *Expected*: Conceptual explanation of TDD

2. **@workspace**:

   ```text
   @workspace Where are the xUnit tests located?
   ```

   *Expected*: Actual file paths in their project

3. **@terminal**:

   ```text
   @terminal Show me the command to build and test
   ```

   *Expected*: `dotnet build && dotnet test` or similar

4. **@vscode**:

   ```text
   @vscode How do I toggle the terminal?
   ```

   *Expected*: Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+\` or Cmd+\`)

**Debrief**:

- Which mode gave the most useful answer for each question?
- When would you use each mode during the labs?

### Key Takeaways for Facilitators

✅ **@workspace is most important** for this workshop - emphasize it!  
✅ **Default chat** is good for learning concepts  
✅ **@terminal** helps with .NET CLI commands  
✅ **Modes are contextual** - teach when to use which  
✅ **Practice makes perfect** - participants learn by using them  

**Don't Overwhelm**:

- Focus on @workspace and default chat primarily
- Introduce other modes as needed during labs
- Reference this appendix for detailed explanations
- Let participants discover advanced usage naturally
