## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this workshop require a GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise license?

The workshop can be delivered with GitHub Copilot Individual, Business, or Enterprise licenses. However, **Business or Enterprise editions are strongly recommended** because they provide:
- Organization-level policy controls and governance
- Enhanced privacy and IP protections
- Usage analytics and insights
- Custom agents and instructions features (introduced December 2024)

### Can we deliver this workshop to a mixed team (both .NET and Java developers)?

The workshop is delivered in either the .NET version or the Spring Boot version. For teams with both .NET and Java developers, we recommend:
- **Option 1**: Deliver both versions in separate sessions (each team gets their stack)
- **Option 2**: Select the version matching your team's primary/strategic technology stack
- **Note**: Universal patterns (Clean Architecture, DDD, TDD) apply to both ecosystems, so concepts transfer across stacks

### What if our team uses a different technology stack (Python, Node.js, etc.)?

While the workshop materials focus on .NET and Spring Boot, the **concepts are universally applicable**:
- TDD with AI assistance works in any language
- Clean Architecture principles apply to Python, Node.js, Go, etc.
- Custom agents and instructions can be adapted to any stack
- Facilitators can discuss adaptation strategies during the workshop

For significant custom content (e.g., Python/Django-specific labs), contact Centric for a tailored engagement.

### How technical are the hands-on labs? Will junior developers struggle?

Labs are designed for **mid-level to senior developers** with 1+ years of professional experience. However:
- Junior developers with strong fundamentals can succeed with pair programming
- Facilitators circulate during labs to provide individual assistance
- Pre-built solutions are available if participants get blocked
- Extension exercises challenge advanced developers

Recommend: Pair junior devs with senior team members during labs.

### Can we record the workshop for future reference or team members who can't attend?

**Virtual sessions**: Recording is possible but subject to:
- GitHub Copilot terms of service (no recording of proprietary AI behaviors/outputs in some cases)
- Participant consent (some may not want to be recorded)
- Centric's agreement (recordings cannot be redistributed or used for training other organizations)

**In-person sessions**: Organizations can record facilitator presentations, but live coding and lab work should not be recorded due to Copilot limitations.

**Alternative**: Centric provides comprehensive lab guides, reference implementations, and documentation that serve as permanent reference materials.

### What's the maximum participant count for effective delivery?

**Recommended maximums**:
- **In-person**: 20-25 participants (allows facilitator to circulate and assist during labs)
- **Virtual**: 15-20 participants (screen-sharing and breakout rooms scale better with smaller groups)

For larger groups (30+), consider:
- Multiple sessions with smaller cohorts
- Co-facilitation with 2 instructors
- Extended lab times to accommodate more questions

### Do participants need to install anything before the workshop?

**Yes, but it's minimal thanks to Dev Containers** (recommended approach):
- Install Docker Desktop (or Podman)
- Install Visual Studio Code with Dev Containers extension
- Install and activate GitHub Copilot extension
- Git (usually already installed on most systems)

**That's it!** All SDKs, frameworks, build tools, and development extensions are pre-configured in the Dev Container. Participants simply open the project in VS Code, select "Reopen in Container," and start coding within minutes.

**Alternative manual setup** (only if organizational policies prevent container usage):
- All of the above PLUS manual installation of .NET 9 SDK or Java 21 JDK, build tools, and extensions

Centric provides a detailed **pre-workshop setup checklist** 1 week before delivery with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting guidance.

### Can we customize the workshop for our organization's specific patterns or frameworks?

Yes! Centric offers **custom content development** for:
- Organization-specific architectural patterns
- Internal framework integration
- Custom agent creation for proprietary workflows
- Legacy codebase modernization scenarios (e.g., internal framework → modern stack)

Custom content requires additional consultation and development time. Contact Centric to discuss scope and pricing.

### What's the difference between this workshop and GitHub's official Copilot training?

Centric's workshop goes beyond basic Copilot usage:
- **Enterprise patterns**: Clean Architecture, DDD, TDD—not just "how to use Copilot"
- **Governance & validation**: How to prevent hallucinations and maintain quality
- **Custom agents & skills**: Advanced customization introduced December 2024 (not yet in most GitHub training)
- **Technology-specific delivery**: .NET or Spring Boot versions with stack-specific examples and patterns
- **Production-ready deliverables**: Participants leave with agents, instructions, and patterns ready for real projects
- **Centric expertise**: Deep enterprise architecture background beyond GitHub product training

### What support is available after the workshop?

**Included**:
- 30 days of email support for technical questions
- Access to updated workshop materials as content evolves
- Lab guides and reference implementations as permanent resources

**Optional (Additional Engagement)**:
- **Hack events**: Centric-facilitated hackathons (1-3 days) where teams apply workshop skills to real organizational challenges
- Embedded coaching (Centric engineer works alongside your team for 1-4 weeks)
- Custom agent development workshops
- Code review and architecture assessment with AI governance guidance
- Ongoing consulting retainer for continuous improvement
