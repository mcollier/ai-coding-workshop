# Custom GitHub Copilot Agents

This directory contains custom agent definitions for GitHub Copilot in VS Code. These agents are specialized AI assistants that provide consistent, role-based guidance for common development workflows.

## What are Custom Agents?

Custom agents are chat participants (invoked with `@agentName`) that have:
- **Specific roles and responsibilities** (e.g., architecture reviewer, test strategist)
- **Defined constraints and guidelines** for consistent behavior
- **Structured output formats** tailored to their purpose
- **Team-aligned practices** encoded as reusable workflows

## Available Agents

### @ArchitectureReviewer
**Purpose:** Review code and design for architectural concerns  
**Use when:** Evaluating structural decisions, boundaries, dependencies  
**Output:** Structured analysis with recommendations

### @BacklogGenerator
**Purpose:** Generate user stories and backlog items from requirements  
**Use when:** Planning features, breaking down work  
**Output:** Formatted user stories with acceptance criteria

### @TestStrategist
**Purpose:** Propose test strategies and identify test scenarios  
**Use when:** Planning test coverage, identifying edge cases  
**Output:** Test plan with categorized scenarios

## Using Agents

### In VS Code
1. Open Copilot Chat
2. Click the **agent dropdown** to select an agent
3. Provide your request or context
4. Use **Agent Mode** for multi-step workflows

### Example Usage
```
Select "Architecture Reviewer" from dropdown:
analyze the task management domain model

Select "Backlog Generator" from dropdown:
create user stories for notification feature

Select "Test Strategist" from dropdown:
propose test scenarios for order validation
```

## Agent Design Principles

✅ **Role-based, not task-based** - Agents represent specialists, not single actions  
✅ **Consistent output format** - Predictable structure aids automation  
✅ **Bounded scope** - Clear responsibilities prevent scope creep  
✅ **Human-in-the-loop** - Agents advise; humans decide

## Governance

- Agent definitions are **version-controlled** in this repository
- Changes require **pull request review** (treat as code)
- See [Agent Governance Guide](../../docs/guides/agent-governance.md) for details

## Creating New Agents

See [Agent Design Guide](../../docs/guides/agent-design-guide.md) for instructions on:
- Defining agent responsibilities
- Writing effective instructions
- Testing and iterating on agent behavior
- Submitting agents for team use

## Workshop Context

These agents are used in **Part 2: Advanced GitHub Copilot** workshop. See:
- [Agent Catalog](../../docs/guides/custom-agent-catalog.md) - Full agent registry
- [Lab 07](../../docs/labs/lab-07-custom-agents-intro.md) - Hands-on introduction
- [Lab 10](../../docs/labs/lab-10-capstone-build-agent.md) - Build your own agent
